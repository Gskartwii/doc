# Guidelines
This project aims to provide documentation for the [Roblox][roblox] Lua
application programming interface (API). This document provides guidelines for
writing API documents for this project.

[roblox]: https://corp.roblox.com/

## Prerequisites

- Writers should be fluent in the language in which they are writing, and should
  have at least an intuitive understanding of the language.
- Writers should be at least moderately familiar with a text editor (opposed to
  a word processor).
- API documentation is written primarily in [Markdown][markdown], of which
  writers should have at least moderate knowledge.
- Writers will benefit from having an unreasonable desire for correctness.

## Languages
Currently, documentation is available in English only, and other languages are
explicitly not provided. This restriction may be relaxed once a majority of
existing documentation can be considered "complete", as this provides a
sufficient reference. Consider the English version a "baseline implementation".

## Terminology
This section defines several terms, which are used throughout this document, but
not necessarily throughout the API documentation.

- An **entity** is a unit or piece of the API. For example, class, property,
  enum, or data type.
- A **primary** entity is defined in relation to no other entities.
- A **secondary** entity belongs to a primary entity; it can only be referred to
  in relation to that entity.
- The entity **type** indicates the kind of entity. This is used to disambiguate
  the names of primary entities.

Primary entities include:

- Classes, type "class"
- Enums, type "enum"
- Data Types, type "type"

Secondary entities include:

- Properties (of class)
- Functions (of class)
- Events (of class)
- Callbacks (of class)
- Enum items (of enum)

Within this document, an element of the form `$VAR` indicates a variable value
within literal content. For example, `class:$CLASS` refers to the literal string
"class:" with a class name appended to it (it could be substituted with
"class:Workspace" or "class:Model", for example).

## Formatting
This section describes requirements and recommendations for formatting the plain
text of documents.

For writing and editing documents, a text editor that supports Markdown is
recommended. A monospace font is recommended.

In general, the plain text itself should be readable and presentable, as though
it were a final rendering of the document. For this reason, simple text and
formatting should be strived for.

Documents are formatted primarily with Markdown. In cases where multiple styles
are available, the following styles are preferred:

- `*text*` for italic text.
- `**text**` for bold text.
- `## Name` for headings (ATX-style). In particular, setext-style headings
  should be avoided.
- `-` for unordered lists.
- `1.` for ordered lists.
- `----` for horizontal rules.
- `` ``` `` for code blocks. Directly after the first set of backticks, a
  language may be specified, for syntax highlighting (e.g. `` ```lua``).

Simple tables may be created with the following format:

```markdown
column 1 | column 2 | column 3
---------|----------|---------
cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3
cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6
```

column 1 | column 2 | column 3
---------|----------|---------
cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3
cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6

Markdown should be used when possible, but HTML elements may be used directly,
if needed.

Generally, text should be wrapped to 80 characters. Exceptions include HTML
elements, or lines containing inline links with long URLs (in this case, it may
be better to use a reference-style link).

Tabs must be used for indentation. There is no required tab length (although 4
is recommended), so text alignment involving tabs must be avoided.

Trailing whitespace (whitespace at the end of lines) must not be present within
documents.

Newlines must be in UNIX format (`\n` rather than `\r\n`).

A document must have one trailing newline at the end of the file.

### Links
In order to decouple documents from a particular rendering, several URI schemes
are defined for referring to other documents or resources. The non-scheme
portion of the URI is a path that should be URL-escaped if needed.

<dl>

<dt><code>res:$PATH</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to a file located in the resource directory. `$PATH` is a relative file
path (e.g. `image.png`).

</dd>

<dt><code>class:$CLASS</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to a class document. `$CLASS` is the name of a class entity.

</dd>

<dt><code>class:$CLASS/$MEMBER</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to a member within a class document. `$CLASS` is the name of a class
entity. `$MEMBER` is the name of a member entity within the class.

</dd>

<dt><code>enum:$ENUM</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to an enum document. `$ENUM` is the name of an enum entity.

</dd>

<dt><code>enum:$ENUM/$MEMBER</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to a member (enum item) within an enum document. `$ENUM` is the name of
an enum entity. `$MEMBER` is the name of an enum item entity within the enum.

</dd>

<dt><code>type:$TYPE</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to a data type document. `$TYPE` is the name of a type entity.

</dd>

<dt><code>member:$MEMBER</code></dt>
<dd>

Refers to a member within the current document. `$MEMBER` is the name of a
secondary entity within the primary entity of the current document.

</dl>

The usual `http` URL scheme can be used to refer to external references (note
that `https` is preferred, when available).

Headings generated by a document can be linked to. The identifier is derived
from the heading name as follows:
- Characters that aren't a letter or digit are converted to dashes (`-`).
- Dashes are collapsed.
- ID is converted to lowercase.
- ID is prefixed with `doc-`.
- Multiple occurrences of an ID are suffixed with `-N`, where in N is a number
  indicating the Nth occurrence of the ID (the first ID does not have the
  suffix).

For example, to link to the first "Foo Bar" heading:

	[Foo Bar](#doc-foo-bar)

The second "Foo Bar" heading:

	[Foo Bar](#doc-foo-bar-2)

When creating new headings, other occurrences of headings with the same name in
the document should be considered, as well as links to those headings. The
heading number within a link may have to be adjusted.

If an entity name is too unwieldy for linking to within a document, then
reference links may be used. The reference should be placed at the top of the
section of the referred entity.

For example:
```markdown
## Changed
A link to [GetPropertyChangedSignal][GPCS].

## GetPropertyChangedSignal
[GPCS]: member:GetPropertyChangedSignal

Description of GetPropertyChangedSignal...
```

More generally, a local reference (within the same document) should be placed at
the top of the referred section.

External references are placed based on where they're used. If such a reference
is used throughtout the entire document, then it should be placed at the bottom
of the document. If it is used only within a single section, then it may be
placed at the bottom of that section.

## File types
Documents have the `.md` file extension, indicating a Markdown file.

Resource file types include anything that can be referred by or embedded into an
HTML file.

## File structure

All documents and related files are located under the `src/` directory.

<dl>

<dt><code>src/</code></dt>
<dd>

The root of the document file tree.

</dd>

<dt><code>src/res/</code></dt>
<dd>

Global resources; embedded images, etc. May contain subdirectories. Files
are visible to all documents.

</dd>

<dt><code>src/doc/</code></dt>
<dd>

Root location of documents.
</dd>

<dt><code>src/doc/$LANG/</code></dt>
<dd>

Documents of a specific language. `$LANG` is an IETF language tag, indicating
the language of the contained documents. For example, `en` represents English.
This directory only contains directories.

</dd>

<dt><code>src/doc/$LANG/$CATEGORY/</code></dt>
<dd>

Documents of a particular category.

Any descendant document of the form `$NAME.md` may have an optional sibling
directory called `$NAME` which contains resource files visible only to that
specific document.

</dd>

<dt><code>src/doc/$LANG/api/</code></dt>
<dd>

Documents of the API category. These are structured to fit with generated API
pages.

</dd>

<dt><code>src/doc/$LANG/api/$TYPE/</code></dt>
<dd>

API entities namespaced by type. There are currently 3 types:

- `class`: API class entities. e.g. Instance, Workspace, Model, Part.
- `enum`: API enum entities. e.g. NormalId, KeyCode, SurfaceType.
- `type`: API data type entities. e.g. bool, int, Vector3, BrickColor.

</dd>

<dt><code>src/doc/$LANG/api/$TYPE/$PRIMARY.md</code></dt>
<dd>

The combination of `$TYPE/$PRIMARY.md` indicates a file that documents the
referred API entity. For example, `class/Workspace.md` documents the *Workspace*
*class*.

</dd>

</dl>

Here are some examples:

- `src/doc/en/api/class/Workspace.md`: Document for the Workspace class in English.
- `src/doc/es/api/enum/NormalId.md`: Document for the NormalId enum in Spanish.
- `src/doc/de/api/type/Vector3.md`: Document for the Vector3 type in German.
- `src/doc/de/api/type/Vector3/example.png`: Resource visible only to `Vector3.md`.

### Sections
Regardless of file type, all documents have their own structure. In general, a
document consists of "sections", which in turn may contain their own
sub-sections. For Markdown, headings are used to delimit sections.

Every entity document should strive to have the following pieces of information:

#### Summary
The Summary section contains a short description of the entity. The very first
sentence should provide an adequate summary on its own, as it may be extracted
and displayed in isolation.

The summary may contain more than one sentence, or even multiple paragraphs, but
it should only provide a quick overview of the entity.

The Summary heading may be omitted; when a section named "Summary" cannot be
found, the "orphan" section is used instead. An orphan section is the content
located after the start of the section, and before the start of the first
subsection. For example:

```markdown
# Entity
This content is treated as the summary.

## Details
This content is treated as the details.
```

This is equivalent to:

```markdown
# Entity

## Summary
This content is treated as the summary.

## Details
This content is treated as the details.
```

Retaining the summary heading is preferred unless it is within a sub-section.

#### Details
The Details section provides absolutely all information about the entity.

Information should never be removed. If the entity changes, the change should be
documented. The main body should contain the current behavior, while previous
behavior is documented elsewhere.

Subsections may include:

- **Quirks**: Notable "gotchas", unexpected or unintuitive behaviors that the
  user should be aware of. Not necessarily bugs.
- **Bugs**: Definite problems with the entity, to the degree that they are
  likely to be fixed in the future.
- **Changes**: Changes to the entity. Previous behavior, along with the date of
  change.

#### Examples
The Examples section contains usable examples of the entity, usually in the form
of code snippets.

An example should strive to be useful; it should be tailored specifically to the
entity, demonstrating its capabilities. Ideally, it should not be possible to
just swap out the entity with another.

An example should be stand-alone; it should be possible to copy the example and
run it in the Studio's command bar. For complex examples were this isn't
possible, prerequisites or instructions should be provided.

#### Members
Depending on the type, a primary entity may have a fourth section, called
"Members". This contains documentation for each secondary entity belonging to
the primary entity.

The name of a direct subsection of Members is the name of the secondary entity.
Sub-sections of this section are the usual Summary, Details, and Examples, as
described above. In this case, *omitting* the Summary heading is preferred.

Direct sub-sections of the Members section should be ordered by name.

## Content
This section describes how documentation should be written.

### Grammar

Avoid personal language. Do not speak to the reader ("you") or about the writer
("I").

When writing, consider the difference between *declaring* what an entity must do
and *explaining* what it does. Explanations should be used in regards to API
entities, and declarations should be reserved for user-controlled elements, such
as callback functions.

*Avoid declaring what an entity must do:*

> GetChildren must return an array of the object's children.

*Instead, explain what the entity does:*

> GetChildren returns an array of the object's children.

In particular, the first sentence of a summary should be written with the
subject omitted, as the subject is usually already nearby.

> #### GetChildren
> Returns an array of the object's children.

Now consider a callback, which receives API-controlled arguments, and returns
user-controlled values. Observe how the speech changes when referring to each of
these subjects:

> The callback receives two numbers. The callback must return true or false.

### Acronyms
The first occurrence of an acronym should be its full form followed by its
abbreviation.

> The Roblox application programming interface (API)

### Stubs
Avoid empty documents or sections. That is, if a class member does not yet have
documentation, then its name should be omitted from the Members section. If an
entire class has no documentation, then it should have no document file.

### Images
Avoid images containing text. If an image requires explanation, write it in the
document near the image.

### Member parameters
Any time a member parameter is referred to, *italics* must be used. To avoid
confusion, italics should be used *only* for parameters. The capitalization of
the parameter must be as given by the API, even at the start of sentences.

```markdown
## FindFirstChild
*name* matches the Name of the child to be found. *recursive* expands the search
to all descendants.
```

Within a member section, a parameter given by name refers to a parameter of the
current member. If a parameter on another member needs to be referred to, use
language that links it to the referred member. e.g. rather than just "*name*",
use "the *name* argument of FindFirstChild".

### Events
A Roblox event (RBXScriptSignal) fires in response to some action. The event
should always be described as firing either before or after the action.

For example, PlayerAdded fires *after* a player is added to the game. When a
listener receives the affected Player object, it will already have its parent
set.

On the other hand, PlayingRemoving fires *before* the player is removed from the
game. That is, it will also still have a parent when received by a listener.

### Linking
Excessive linking should be avoided. If an entity is referred to multiple times,
then only first reference needs to be linked. On the other hand, sparse linking
should also be avoided.

To decide whether a reference should be linked, consider how the reader will
view the content. That is, if a reader can jump directly to a particular
section, then the first occurrence of the reference, in relation to that
section, should be linked. This is because the reader will have skipped over any
previous content, and so will have missed a previous link of that reference.

For example:

```markdown
## ChildAdded
This section refers to [Parent](member:Parent). A second reference to Parent is
made, but it is not linked.

## ChildRemoving
This section also refers to [Parent](member:Parent). It is also linked despite
being the third reference in this document, because a reader is able to jump
directly to this section.
```

Generally, treat *only* the following sections as if they can be jumped to
directly:

- The Summary section of a primary entity.
- The Details section of a primary entity.
- The Examples section of a primary entity.
- The section of a secondary entity.

This rule is not absolute. It may be worth linking a reference if the section is
long and detailed enough to have subsections, or if the subject has changed and
the reference hasn't appeared recently.

### Common terminology
Several terms are defined for use across the entire API documentation body.

<dl>

<dt>object</dt>
<dd>An instance of the current class. For example, a member is described in the
context of a class, so an instance of that class is referred to as "the object".
"The current object" may be used when differentiating between the object and
others. In particular, avoid using "instance", as this already has a specific
definition in the context of the API.</dd>

<dt>member</dt>
<dd>A secondary entity belonging to a class. Distinct from "child", which
involves a hierarchical relationship with another object.</dd>

<dt>user</dt>
<dd>A user of the current entity. Only use specific terms like "developer" when
describing something that applies only to that type of user.</dd>

<dt>game</dt>
<dd>A collection of place files, assets, data stores, settings, stats, active
servers, etc.</dd>

<dt>universe</dt>
<dd>Equivalent to "game". Used where "game" would be ambiguous.</dd>

<dt>place</dt>
<dd>A file containing a single game tree. May also refer to an actively running
job of such.</dd>

<dt>job</dt>
<dd>An active copy of a place running on a peer. Avoid using "instance".</dd>

<dt>player</dt>
<dd>A person playing a game on Roblox.</dd>

<dt>character</dt>
<dd>A player's in-game avatar.</dd>

<dt>peer</dt>
<dd>A program that runs Roblox, or the device on which such a program runs.</dd>

<dt>client</dt>
<dd>A peer that runs on the player's device.</dd>

<dt>server</dt>
<dd>A peer that serves clients.</dd>

<dt>game tree</dt>
<dd>A complete object hierarchy with a DataModel as its root.</dd>

<dt>DataModel</dt>
<dd>The root object of a game tree. Literally of the <code>DataModel</code>
class. "Workspace", which sometimes occurs in the wild, must not be used for
this.</dd>

<dt>developer</dt>
<dd>A person who develops games on Roblox.</dd>

<dt>engineer</dt>
<dd>A person who develops Roblox.</dd>

<dt>Remote</dt>
<dd>Referring to both RemoteFunctions and RemoteEvents. Should be
capitalized.</dd>

<dt>Bindable</dt>
<dd>Referring to both BindableFunctions and BindableEvents. Should be
capitalized.</dd>

<dt>save</dt>
<dd>To store a place, model, or other asset locally on the user's device.</dd>

<dt>publish</dt>
<dd>To upload a place, model, or other asset to Roblox.</dd>

</dl>

### Media
This section describes how media resources should be handled.

Plan ahead. Deliberate the content before committing to creating it.

**Do everything possible to reduce the file size.** Optimize. Play with encoding
settings. Avoid files over 1MB.

The dimensions of an image or video should only be as large as needed for the
sake of clarity.

An audio or video should only be as long as needed to get the point across.
Video used purely for visual demonstration must not have an audio track.

Images must be encoded as either PNG or JPEG. **GIFs are forbidden.** Video must
be encoded as MPEG-4/H.264. Audio (including within video) must be encoded as
MP3.

Markdown does not support audio/video elements, so they must be inlined via
HTML. Preloading should be completely disabled. **Audio and video must never
auto-play.**

### Other
This section lists other minor details to consider.

- Errors, warnings, and other such messages are merely "emitted", rather than
  having a specific result such as being "displayed in output". Errors in
  particular are usually "thrown", and can be "caught" by `pcall` or coroutines.
