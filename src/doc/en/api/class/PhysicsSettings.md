## PhysicsEnvironmentalThrottle
Controls the amount of throtting applied to physics simulation.

Throttling is represented as a percentage of the normal simulation rate. 100%
throttling means that the simulation is running at the usual rate, 50% means the
simulation is runing at half the speed, and 0% means the simulation is stopped.
