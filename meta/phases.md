# Phases
Due to the vast size of the Roblox Lua API, work is divided into a number of
**phases**. Phases apply to each document individually. For a document to move
on to the next phase, it must satisfy the **conditions** of the current phase.
Each phase also has a **life cycle**, which describes generally how content
should be produced and submitted.

Phases also apply to the entire project itself, which gives it focus overall.
Once a particular document satisfies the conditions of the project's current
phase, rather than moving on to the next phase for the document, the writer
should move on to other documents. Once most or all documents satisfy the
current phase, then the project can move on to the next phase.

*The project is currently in **Phase 1: Words***

## Phase 1: Words
The purpose of this phase is to provide the meat of the reference. Entities must
be described. Lots of words must be written. Descriptions of behaviors must be
verified for accuracy.

Occasionally, media works better than words. If it takes significantly more
effort to write a description than it does to take a screenshot, it's okay to
just take a screenshot.

**Conditions**: All entities within a document must have a summary and a detailed
description. Behaviors must be verified and described accurately.

**Life cycle**:
1. Make. Write words. Describe the behavior of entities. Verify the correctness
   of these descriptions.
2. Refine. Submit the content for review. Allow others to verify correctness,
   improve wording, and so on. Refine the content until it is pristine.
3. Merge. Deploy the content to the website.

## Phase 2: Garnish
The purpose of this phase is to enhance descriptions with images, video, audio,
and so on, as needed. Most entities will not require media, and a lot of media
will end up being more appropriate as examples, so this phase should be a lot
shorter than others.

**Conditions**: All entities within a document must be evaluated for the
inclusion of media. For entities deemed appropriate, media is produced and
included in the document.

**Life cycle**:
1. Deliberate. For large media, submit a description of the content before
   producing it. Allow others to share their input. (i.e. Don't spend hours
   producing a video only to have it rejected.)
2. Produce. Create the content. Take a screenshot. Shoot a video. Record audio.
3. Refine. Submit a rough cut for review. Allow others to make suggestions on
   details. Refine until pristine. Render the final cut.
4. Merge. Deploy the content to the website.

## Phase 3: Examples
The purpose of this phase is to fill in the final section of each item:
Examples.

**Conditions**: All entities with a document must have at least one example
which satisfies the requirements defined in the [guidelines](GUIDELINES.md).

**Life cycle**:
1. Make. Write code. Take screenshots. Create attachments. For large media,
   follow the Phase 2 life cycle.
2. Refine. Submit the content for review. Allow others to verify correctness,
   improve wording, and so on. Refine the content until it is pristine.
3. Merge. Deploy the content to the website.

## Phase 4: Expansion
*The other aspects of documentation*

This phase addresses the fact that a reference is only one aspect of a complete
documentation suite:

- Reference: information-oriented
- **Tutorials**: learning-oriented
- **Guides**: problem-oriented
- **Discussions**: understanding-oriented

The planning of this phase is currently incomplete.
