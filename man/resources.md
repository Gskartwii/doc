# Resources
This page describes the production, formatting, and handling of resources.

Plan ahead. Deliberate the content before committing to creating it.

**Do everything possible to reduce the file size.** Reduce the duration and
dimensions. Optimize. Play with encoding settings. Avoid files over 1MB.

The dimensions of an image or video should only be as large as needed for the
sake of clarity.

Audio and video should have durations that are only as long as needed to get the
point across. Video used purely for visual demonstration must not have an audio
track.

Visual media should avoid text for the purpose of explanation. Likewise, audio
should avoid spoken words for the same reason. If media requires an explanation,
write it in the document near the media.

## Images
Images must be static, and encoded as either PNG or JPEG. **GIFs are absolutely
forbidden.**

Use PNG for flat images with less colors. Use JPG for noisy images with many
colors. When in doubt, select the smaller file size.

## Video
Video must be encoded as MPEG-4/H.264. Audio within a video must be encoded as
MP3.

Markdown does not support video elements, so they must be inlined via HTML.
Preloading should be completely disabled. **Videos must never auto-play.**

## Audio
Audio must be encoded as MP3.

Markdown does not support audio elements, so they must be inlined via HTML.
Preloading should be completely disabled. **Audio must never auto-play.**

## Attachments
Attachments are usually in the form of Roblox place or model files. These are
generally reserved for complex examples.
